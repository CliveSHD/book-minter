* Introduction
I love reading books, so I decided to create a DApp that allows me to create my own e-books and mint them as NFTs.

What the app can do:
1. Connect your wallet
2. Choose a book file (epub) to upload
3. Enter your book's name
4. Write an introduction or description
5. Enter the ISBN number if available
6. Press the "Mint Book" button
7. Wait a moment, and your book will become an NFT on the Sepolia network

* Back end
Solidity + Ethers + Hardhat.

I chose ERC-1155 so that I can mint multiple copies of a book.

The contract is deployed on the Sepolia test network.

* Front end
React + Chakra UI + Vite.
